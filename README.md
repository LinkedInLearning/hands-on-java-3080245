Java is one of the most popular open-source programming languages that’s currently available on the market. It’s used widely in different industries all over the world, where it’s become something of a must-have for developers. Are you ready to get your skills up to speed? Or are you at risk of falling behind? Join instructor Angie Jones for a hands-on introduction to basic coding in Java. Learn how to develop an online banking system with Java by testing out your new skills in the examples and exercises. Find out what it takes to build up your confidence to interact with object models, decision structures, and external databases. Angie guides you through the best practices for designing and implementing a fully formed piece of software that you can add to your portfolio. Why wait to push your Java skills to the next level when you can keep learning on your own today?<br><br>The best way to learn a language is to use it in practice. That’s why this course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. Check out the [Using GitHub Codespaces with this course][gcs-video-url] video to learn how to get started.


## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
